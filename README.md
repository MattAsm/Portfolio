I'm going to need to be absolutely honest here. I don't know enough about git or github desktop or github to understand the hoops i just went through to deploy this site live as a React project. Somehow it's up and running live. If it's not working, it means i tried to commit another application to my portfolio and messed something up again.

TLDR: Site works great 👍
